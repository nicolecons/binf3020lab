We will be working with Python, mainly using the [NetworkX](https://networkx.org) package which implements many of the methods for network or graph analysis we covered (there are other alternatives with similar functionality, such as iGraph, Pajek, Gephi, Cytoscape, etc). You need to work through the notebook and complete the answers to questions in the notebook cells. Note: you may need to do some reading beyond the lecture notes to complete your answers.\n",
