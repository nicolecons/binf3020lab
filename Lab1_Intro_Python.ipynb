    "# Lab 1 Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, you will be applying and implementing some aspects of the lecture materials using Python.  Although Python is a general-purpose programming language and many of you are already familiar with it, its importance for data-oriented applications is due to the range of packages available for tasks such as data analysis, statistics, linear algebra, machine learning, and visualization. The work in these notebooks is intended to give you practical experience with setting up and running these tools on realistic datasets.\n",
