    "# Lab 1 Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, you will be applying and implementing some aspects of the lecture materials using Python.  Although Python is a general-purpose programming language and many of you are already familiar with it, its importance for data-oriented applications is due to the range of packages available for tasks such as data analysis, statistics, linear algebra, machine learning, and visualization. The work in these notebooks is intended to give you practical experience with setting up and running these tools on realistic datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few concepts you should have some understanding of to complete this work. The following are some resources that may help:\n",

However, this is not a Python course - the focus is on applying practical machine learning algorithms, and Python is simply a tool for us to do so.\n",

    "#### Reading Datasets\n",
    "In order to perform any kind of statistics or machine learning we typically need a significant amount of data. By visualizing the data, analysing patterns to understand the data and using algorithms to fit models to the data, we can achieve meaningful results. Scikit-learn makes it easy for us to access some pre-defined 'toy' datasets to practice our understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll use the \"diabetes\" dataset, which contains records for 442 diabetes patients. The 10 features in the dataset represent each patient's age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements. The response of interest is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline. We'll use this to fit a linear regression model to predict a patient's disease progression based on any of their features.\n",
